## Creating word2vec using continous bag of words model 
 
This is an implementation of the continous bag of words model by directly using the equations described in the paper. Given a text corpus, this implementation will product wordvec for each word in the text corpus. I have yet to do some optimization like negative sampling and others in the model to fine tune the model.
